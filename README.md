On this repo you can find the solution to an exercise meant to make it possible 
to apply the knoweledge about programming within the imperative paradigm
through the C programming language

The exercise is the following:

Write a program that reads the words in a document (.txt) and prints out:
1. Each (uncommon) word and a list of the line numbers in which it appears.
2. The different words sorted in descending order by their number of occurrences.
